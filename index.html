        <h1>Monster Hunter</h1>
        <h3>Game</h3>
        <p>Monster Hunter (モンスターハンター) is a media franchise developed and published by Capcom. The first game of the
            series released for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. The current new title is Monster Hunter Rise, released on
            March 26, 2021 worldwide.</p>
        <p>In Monster Hunter, the player slips into the role of a monster hunter, who uses a huge selection of armor and
            weapons of various classes to free the medieval-themed world from monsters.</p>
        <p>Monster Hunter (モンスターハンター, Monsutā Hantā) is a Japanese media franchise centered on a series of
            fantasy-themed action role-playing video games that started with the game Monster Hunter for the PlayStation
            2, released in 2004. Titles have been released across a variety of platforms, including personal computers,
            home consoles, portable consoles, and mobile devices. The series is developed and published by Capcom.</p>
        <p>The games are primarily action role-playing games. The player takes the role of a Hunter, slaying or
            trapping large monsters across various landscapes as part of quests given to them by locals, with some
            quests involving the gathering of a certain item or items, which may put the Hunter at risk of facing
            various monsters. As part of its core gameplay loop, players use loot gained from slaying monsters,
            gathering resources, and quest rewards to craft improved weapons, armor, and other items that allow them to
            face more powerful monsters. All main series titles feature multiplayer (usually up to four players
            cooperatively), but can also be played single player.
        </p>
        <p>As of December 31, 2022, the game series has sold 90 million units worldwide, and is Capcom's second
            best-selling series following Resident Evil. The early games in the series principally sold well in Japan
            and other Asian countries, popularized by the series' use of ad hoc multiplayer features on portable
            consoles. Monster Hunter has been critically well received in Western markets, but had generally languished
            in sales, in part due to the game's steep learning curve. However, with Monster Hunter: World (2018), Capcom
            aimed to attract a global audience using the power of advanced home gaming consoles and computers and
            released the title simultaneously worldwide. World became the best-selling Monster Hunter game within three
            days of its release, and became Capcom's single best-selling video game of all time with 21 million sales as
            of July 5, 2022, including more than 70% outside of Japan.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to games, the franchise has an anime based on the spinoff game Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka
            Airou Village, Monster Hunter Stories: Ride On based on the spinoff title Monster Hunter Stories, a manga
            Monster Hunter Orage, and a book Monster Hunter Episode. A feature film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson
            was released on December 3, 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            An animated film, subtitled Legends of the Guild, was released on August 12, 2021, on Netflix.

        <h3>General Info</h3>

        <h4>Weapon Types</h4>

        <p>There are 18 types of weapons in the Monster Hunter universe, with three of them (MBG, CB, IG) exclusive to
            the main series,two (Tonfa and Magnet Spike) exclusive to Monster Hunter Frontier Z and one (Accel Axe)
            exclusive to Monster Hunter Explore. Weapons were divided into two different classes: melee and ranged. The
            type of armor worn by hunters (with the exception of head gear) is dependent on these classes, with melee
            weapons requiring blademaster armor and ranged weapons requiring gunner armor. Only a few "neutral" armor
            sets (e.g., Leather or Chainmail) allow for the use of either class.</p>
        <p>Monster Hunter World removed class restrictions on armor altogether, allowing hunters to pair any armor set
            with any type of weapon. Melee weapons provide more physical defense, while ranged weapons offer more
            elemental resistance.</p>
        <p>Each weapon causes certain types of damage: cutting, impact, pierce and shot. The weak spots of a monster
            may vary depending on the type of damage dealt to it. Cutting damage is notably useful for slicing off the
            tails of certain monsters, while impact damage can both stun and exhaust most monsters over time with
            repeated strikes to the head. Shot damage can have a variety of damaging effects on a monster depending on
            the type of ammo used (e.g., pierce, crag, or slicing).</p>
        <p>Most weapons are capable of delivering two or more types of damage, with varying efficiency. For example,
            the Sword and Shield and Great Sword primarily focus on dealing cutting damage, but are also capable of
            causing impact damage with certain attacks. A few weapons, such as the hammer and long sword, strictly focus
            on utilizing impact and cutting damage respectively.</p>
        <p>The armor skills Punishing Draw and Sheath Control are notable for allowing cutting weapons like dual blades
            and long swords to deliver impact damage with sheathing attacks.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Element</h4>

        Elements (属性 or Attributes) are the secondary damage done by a Weapon's or a Monster's attack. Like raw damage,
        it is done directly. How much the Element effects a Monster or a Hunter is dependent on the monster's
        weaknesses, resistances, or the Hunter's equipped Armor Pieces or Armor Sets. Specific parts in a Monster's body
        may have differing Elemental Weaknesses and Resistances.

        The original Elements in the game are Fire, Water, Thunder and Dragon. The Ice Element was introduced during the
        Second Generation, Elements combined with Ailments were introduced during Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, and
        combined Elements were introduced during Monster Hunter Frontier G.

        Beginning at the Third Generation, a Monster's Elemental attacks may inflict status conditions known as Blights.
        Each Elemental Blight may inflict different conditions that and can be removed or prevented through actions or
        the use of Recovery Items. These Blights may increase on its severity depending on the Hunter's Element
        Resistance Skills on their Armor Set, or if the Hunter has been hit multiple times with the Elemental Attack.

        <h3>Monsters</h3>

        <p>Monsters are the central aspect of the Monster Hunter series. Monsters are (by Monster Hunter definition)
            creatures in the World of Monster Hunter. Many look natural, but some of them have a mythical appearance,
            and some of them possess mystical, supernatural, and even divine powers. Each of these monsters have
            abilities that can make them pose a challenge to any hunter. Monsters provide materials, success, fame and
            glory as hunting them progresses the hunter through the game.</p>

        <h4>Monster Classes</h4>

        <p>These are the main classes of monsters that are currently known by the in game lore.</p>
        <h5>Lynian</h5>
        <p>Lynians (Japanese: 獣人種 Jūjinshu, "Beastman species") are intelligent creatures, typically of short stature,
            that appear to be mammalian. Living in tribes, they share common cultures, dialects, and have recognized
            leaders. Lynians can be divided into cats (Melynx, Felyne, and Grimalkyne) and apes (Uriki, Shakalaka,
            Gajalaka and Boaboa). Although the apes are somewhat primitive, the cats are typically peaceful and often
            coexist with humans.</p>

        <h5>Herbivore</h5>
        <p>Herbivores (Japanese: 草食種 Sōshokushu) are animals that feeds on plants. Most other creatures prey on
            herbivores, as they are often abundant. Herbivores are typically passive, and therefore pose little threat
            to a hunter. Within the Herbivore class there are both mammalian and reptilian creatures.</p>

        <h5>Fish</h5>
        <p>Fishes (Japanese: 魚類 Gyorui) are limbless, cold-blooded vertebrates with gills and fins, living wholly in
            water. A variety of species exist, and they can be classified as migratory fish (Japanese 回遊魚 Kaiyūgyo),
            swimming fish (Japanese 遊泳魚 Yūeigyo) and carnivorous fish (Japanese 肉食魚 Nikushokugyo). Fish are fed on by
            numerous other aquatic, or semiaquatic, creatures.</p>

        <h5>Wingdrake</h5>
        <p>Wingdrakes (Japanese: 翼竜種 Yokuryūshu) are small wyverns, often resembling birds or pterosaurs. Using a
            grappling hook, a wingdrake can be hooked onto and used as a method of transportation.</p>

        <h5>Neopteron</h5>
        <p>Neopterons (Japanese: 甲虫種 Kōchūshu, "Beetle species") are insectoid monsters known for their rigid carapaces.
            These monsters can range in size from tiny to enormous, and some species can fly, while others cannot.
            Neopterons are very susceptible to poison and fire, yet hold quite a resistance to the Dragon Element. Their
            materials are often used to make very sharp weapons.</p>

        <h5>Temnoceran</h5>
        <p>Temnocerans (Japanese 鋏角種 Kyōkakushu, "Chelicerate species") are a class of monster first introduced in
            Monster Hunter 4. This class is characterized by its arachnoid characteristics, such as the ability to
            produce silk, though they have six limbs similar to Neopterons or Carapaceons. However, some Temnocerans
            have been noted to have eight limbs, such as Rakna-Kadaki.</p>

        <h5>Bird Wyvern</h5>
        <p>Bird Wyverns (Japanese: 鳥竜種 Chōryūshu) are a class of monsters introduced in the first generation. They are a
            small to medium sized class that includes Flying Wyverns with slender bodies that are bipedal and, in some
            cases, either have wings or lack wings.</p>
        <p>There are two distinct types of Bird Wyverns: Flying Bird Wyverns and Theropod Bird Wyverns. Flying Bird
            Wyverns exhibit similar characteristics to True Wyverns, with a bipedal stance along with developed and
            functional wings. Many of these possess a hard, sharp beak which can be used to peck at attackers, and
            generally behave in a bird-like manner. Theropod Bird Wyverns are reminiscent of Brute Wyverns: flightless,
            bipedal creatures with long tails and powerful legs. Unlike Brute Wyverns however, these monsters are
            generally quite small. Furthermore, Theropod Bird Wyverns almost always live under a social hierarchy, with
            young individuals, females and beta males led by a strong, dominant alpha male, which can command and
            control his subjects during combat.</p>

        <h5>Flying Wyvern</h5>
        <p>Flying Wyverns (Japanese: 飛竜種 Hiryūshu) are large, bipedal monsters that have two wings that were first
            introduced in the First Generation. Known for their mastery of flight, a majority of the monsters in this
            classification have evolved powerful wings that allow them to fly. However, some Flying Wyverns are
            quadrupedal, utilizing their wings as forearms to further enhance their movements on land, while other
            members in this class are flightless, or even wingless despite their classification. In the other hand, some
            winged ones are less capable of sustained flight.</p>
        <p>Flying Wyverns make up a large majority of the monsters in the Monster Hunter franchise.</p>

        <h5>Piscine Wyvern</h5>
        <p>Piscine Wyverns (Japanese: 魚竜種 Gyoryūshu) are a class of monsters introduced in the first generation. This
            class is made up of wyvern-like fish that have evolved to be specialized in swimming in just about anything,
            mainly water, and that lack the ability to fly. These monsters are sluggish on land, though can balance
            themselves on land with their hindlegs.</p>

        <h5>Carapaceon</h5>
        <p>Carapaceons (Japanese: 甲殻種 Kōkakushu) are crustacean-like or scorpion-like monsters that were introduced in
            the Second Generation, having hard shells, exoskeletons, or crab-like bodies, which mostly require weapons
            with at least green sharpness to break. When they're weakened by physical damage, they show internal
            bleeding by the frothing of the purple bubbles from their mouths. Most of these crustaceans resemble crabs,
            lobsters or scorpions.</p>

        <h5>Amphibian</h5>
        <p>Amphibians (Japanese: 両生種 Ryōseishu) are a class of monster first introduced in Monster Hunter 4. They are
            superficially frog-like in body structure, with powerful, spring-like back legs and muscular forelegs. They
            are known to inhabit a diverse range of environments and are typically carnivorous.</p>

        <h5>Primatus/Pelagus/Fanged Beasts</h5>
        <p>Fanged Beasts (Japanese: 牙獣種 Gajūshu), also known as Pelagus and Primatius monsters in early titles, are
            beastly, mammalian creatures that lack wings (although some have the ability to glide) introduced in Monster
            Hunter 2. They are often much faster than other larger threats.
        </p>
        <p>Fanged Beasts were referred to as 'Primatius' in earlier translations due to almost all of the existing
            members being similar to real-world primates (such as Rajang), although the translation was changed to
            'Pelagus' in Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. More varieties of these monsters were added in MHP3 (such as the
            bear-like Arzuros), and were titled 'Fanged Beasts' in the Japanese version. The name 'Fanged Beasts' was
            used from the English version of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate onwards, and later games have introduced more
            varieties of these monsters.
        </p>
        <h5>Leviathan</h5>
        <p>Leviathans (Japanese: 海竜種 Kairyūshu) are a class of monsters first appearing in the third generation. This
            class consists of large wyverns that are specialized in swimming. Leviathans are known to usually be the top
            predators of their environments like Flying Wyverns.</p>

        <h5>Snake Wyvern</h5>
        <p>Snake Wyverns (Japanese: 蛇竜種 Jaryūshu) are a class of monster first introduced in Monster Hunter 4. These
            monsters are known for their serpentine features, such as long, coiling bodies and forked tongues. They can
            range dramatically in both size and overall body structure, with some members being large, serpentine
            land-dwellers, while others are smaller and more reminiscent of Flying Wyverns.</p>

        <h5>Brute Wyvern</h5>
        <p>Brute Wyverns (Japanese: 獣竜種 Jūryūshu) are a flightless group of wyverns first introduced in the Third
            Generation. Greatly resembling nonfictional theropods, these monsters are well adapted for life on land,
            using their powerful hindlimbs to get around from place to place rather than using wings or other means to
            travel.[5] A common trait that most Brute Wyverns share is the small forelimbs that they can barely use, but
            there are some exceptions that have heavily developed those limbs to use in combat.[6]</p>

        <h5>Fanged Wyvern</h5>
        <p>Fanged Wyverns (Japanese: 牙竜種 Garyūshu) are a class of monster first introduced in Monster Hunter Portable
            3rd. They are known for being Fanged Beast-like Wyvern monsters that have highly developed limbs. Up until
            the Fifth Generation, the only known species of these wyverns were Zinogre and its variations. The Fifth
            Generation introduced many notable Fanged Wyverns, such as Tobi-Kadachi, Odogaron, Magnamalo, and Lunagaron.
        </p>

        <p>With the new additions to this classification, the common traits of the Fanged Wyverns have been narrowed to
            being quadrupedal and having wingless forelimbs larger than their hindlimbs, while other body structures may
            vary; some like Odogaron and Tobi-Kadachi anchor their weight completely on their limbs pointing downward,
            while Great Jagras or Dodogama occasionally drag their bodies with limbs spreading to the sides, not unlike
            Leviathans. A common trait shared among many Fanged Wyverns is their agility and speed; however, several
            Fanged Wyverns, like the aforementioned Great Jagras and Dodogama, are much less nimble.</p>

        <h5>Elder Dragons</h5>
        <p>Elder Dragons (Japanese: 古龍種 Koryūshu) are a class of monsters introduced in the first generation. Unlike
            other monster types, which classify monsters by shared traits, Elder Dragons are creatures that defy typical
            classification and reside outside of the standard ecosystem, regardless of their resemblance to a dragon.
            These monsters are rare creatures with immense power that have lived since ancient times.</p>

        <h5>Unknown</h5>
        <p>??? (Japanese: ???) or Unknown are a class of monster first introduced in Monster Hunter 4. These monsters
            belong to an as-of-yet unknown class within the context of the game. The difference between this class and
            the Unclassified Monster class is that these monsters have been officially identified in-game as unknown,
            whereas the typing of Unclassified Monsters is not referred to at all within the game.</p>
