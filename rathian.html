    <h1>Rathian</h1>

    <p><strong>Rathian</strong> are female Flying Wyverns introduced in Monster Hunter. Mostly being a female of the
        Rathalos monster</p>

    <h2>Physiology</h2>

    <p>Rathian is a medium-sized true flying wyvern similar in looks to her male counterpart, Rathalos. Her hide is a
        dull, muted green in contrast to the Rathalos's deep red, and her lower mandible features a long, protruding
        chin spike. Her upper back and wingtips are covered in a moss-like fur not seen on the Rathalos, and while her
        clubbed tail lacks bony spikes, it makes up for this with the presence of sharp and highly poisonous needles,
        which she can use to poison foes upon contact.</p>

    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <p>Rathian, like her mate, can generate flaming projectiles from her mouth. She is notably more proficient in the
        use of this weapon however, as she is commonly seen releasing multiple blasts at once. In addition, she is
        capable of charging up and releasing a more potent fire blast which can ignite a swath of ground in front of
        her. She can use the poisonous barbs on her tail club to inflict blunt-force, toxic wounds on foes, even if her
        tail was cut off. Her powerful legs allow her to run at high speeds, making her easily capable of chasing down
        most prey. Like the Rathalos, her vision is very keen, so Flash Bombs are useful in combat.</p>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <p>Rathian is very territorial, choosing to patrol from ground while her Rathalos mate patrols from the sky. She
        will become very aggressive to potential threats, especially when in close proximity to her nest and young.
        Rathian and Rathalos will always go after hunters that are carrying their eggs.</p>
    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>Rathians can survive in almost any territory, but prefers areas with average temperature for nesting. As a
        result, she is known to be encountered in a large variety of areas such as the Jungle, Sandy Plains, and Primal
        Forest.</p>
